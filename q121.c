// Q121: Write a C program that creates a text file named info.txt in write mode. 
//The program should take the user’s name and age as input, and 
//write them to the file using fprintf(). After writing,
// display a message confirming that the data was successfully saved.

// /*
// Sample Test Cases:
// Input 1:
// Name: Rahul, Age: 23
// Output 1:
// File created successfully! Data written to info.txt

// */
